## About The Project
The project was to create a new language called Alpha. We created a set of rules with flex and we code the compiler and the virtual environment. By the end we had a new language that run on any pc with the AVE (Alpha Virtual Environment), The language is Turing Complete and has many useful features. The project was graded with a 9.5 out of 10.
